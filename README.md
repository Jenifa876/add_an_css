# add_an_css
## Description
This project demonstrates three methods of adding CSS to an HTML document: inline, internal, and external. Each method is showcased in its own HTML file, illustrating how to apply styles in different ways.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing links to the three CSS methods.
- `inline.html`: Demonstrates the inline CSS method with a heading styled directly in the HTML tag.
- `internal.html`: Demonstrates the internal CSS method, with styles defined in a `<style>` tag within the `<head>`.
- `external.html`: Demonstrates the external CSS method, linking to a separate CSS file for styling.
